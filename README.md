### Notes:
- [API] I just pick some test cases from the list and write the automation test scripts for it to cover CRUD pet API
- The pet API is NOT stable and working correctly for testing, eg: First time, I call API to get a pet, it returns 404 - not found, I call it again, it returns the pet details. The same apply for deleting pet as well
